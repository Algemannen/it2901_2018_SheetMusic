# ScoresButler

### What is this?

ScoresButler is a sheet music management application for orchestras and bands. It makes it easier to sort, archive and distribute their sheets. It uses RegEx to extract information from the PDFs for labeling the instruments.

### Getting started

Clone the repo and run `npm install`or `yarn install`.

To run the server, type `npm start` or `yarn start`.

The server and database is hosted by Google on their Firebase platform, so no installation is necessary.
